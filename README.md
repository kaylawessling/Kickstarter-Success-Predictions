# Kickstarter-Success-Predictions

This project is intended to provide guidance for anyone wishing to launch a Kickstarter campaign. I sought to answer the question: which fiscal quarter yields the most successful Kickstarter campaigns in the United States?
Parsing the data and using the count method, I was able to return the number of successful campaigns per quarter, visualizing my findings using a standard bar plot.

The dataset used was found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/yashkantharia/kickstarter-campaigns/version/1. I focused my analysis primarily on the quarter which campaigns ended, as well as if they were successful or not.

Although my research was exteremely simplistic, there are a ton more questions that could sought to be answered using the dataset. I would encourage anyone who would like to increase their liklihood of fully-funding a campaign to use it in their own analysis.
